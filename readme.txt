Run R file "2014-01 CSO_SOM.R" line by line in RStudio to see SOM details.

This example works with Irish census data from 2011 in the Dublin area, develops a SOM and demonstrates how 
to visualise the results. An accomanying blog post is available online, along with an extensive set of 
slides that contain a secondary grocery shopping example.
